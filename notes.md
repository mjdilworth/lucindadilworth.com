Exhibition Overview:
In the summer of 2023, I presented an immersive art exhibition titled "Artificial Impression" in Paros, Greece, my birthplace. The exhibition was inspired by George Orwell's "1984" and explored themes of Big Brother, suppression, control, surveillance, and the unique challenges faced by women in society today. The collection comprised 18 individual art pieces, each with its own animation, designed to bring the artworks to life and engage the audience in a thought-provoking experience.

Creation of Artwork and Animations:
To bring this vision to life, I employed a combination of digital art creation tools. I used Procreate and Illustrator to craft the artwork, ensuring that each piece conveyed a powerful message. Then, I incorporated various animation techniques, including hand-drawn 2D animations and AI animation tools like Kaiber. These animations evolved over time, giving each figure a dynamic presence.

Immersive Projection Mapping:
The heart of the exhibition lay in the use of projection mapping, where the animations were meticulously mapped directly onto the printed artworks. With the help of VDMX, a live video editing software, I was able to manipulate the animations in real-time, allowing the narrative to unfold and the audience to immerse themselves in the emotions conveyed by the art. Madmapper was used to ensure each animation was placed precisely over the artwork, with light giving life to the static images.

Projection Mapping and Canvas:
The canvas and prints served as the canvas for projection mapping. This unique approach brought attention and interest from the audience, captivating them as they witnessed the artwork coming to life through animation. It created a seamless connection between the static images and the evolving story.

Live Video Editing:
The use of live video editing through VDMX enabled the exhibition to evolve dynamically, allowing real-time alterations to the effects and images. This added an element of unpredictability and engagement to the experience, making each visit to the exhibition unique.

Creating an Immersive Atmosphere:
The overarching goal was to create a calm, yet hypnotising atmosphere that drew visitors into the stories of the characters. The immersive environment allowed people to sense the emotions and narratives each artwork aimed to convey.

Challenges and Innovations:
One of the technical challenges faced was managing the ambient light in the exhibition space, which affected the quality of the projectors. However, this challenge sparked innovation as I began projecting onto the surrounding walls, expanding the art's scope. This change contributed to the immersive experience and a more connected narrative.

Future Plans:
Building on the success of this exhibition, I plan to expand the concept further. In November 2023, I will be presenting a fully projected and immersive room in Hoxton, London. This time, the entire space will feature six projectors, filling the room and mapping every wall with art and movement, creating a truly mesmerising and all-encompassing experience.

In conclusion, "Artificial Impression" was an exploration of Orwellian themes brought to life through a fusion of digital art, animations, projection mapping, and live video editing, creating an immersive journey that captivated and moved its audience.
